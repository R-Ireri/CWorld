# CWorld- Temperature Wizard
This is a simple C program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides a user-friendly interface to input a temperature value and select the desired conversion.
# How to Use
>Compile the code: Use a C compiler like GCC to compile the source code into an executable file.

>Run the executable: Execute the generated executable file.

>Input temperature: Enter the temperature value you want to convert.

>Select conversion: Choose the desired conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Kelvin, Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, or Kelvin to Fahrenheit).

>View the result: The program will display the converted temperature.

# Code Structure
The code is structured into functions for each conversion type, making it modular and easy to understand. The main function handles user input and output.

# Future Improvements
>Error Handling: Implement error handling for invalid input values.

>User Interface: Enhance the user interface with a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like GTK+ or Qt.

>Additional Features: Add features like temperature history and favorite conversions.
